Hello,
This is my project submission for Summer Internship Evaluation for the university of Amity University Haryana for the academic year 2025/26.
This is a cpu review summariser project.
Idea:
As an avid fan of technology launchings one of the industries i follow very closely is the personal computer industry.
And often times when reading reviews. It becomes a tedious task to read all the reviews.
So this project was created to get review articles from more than 1 site summarise them and then present it as a review that contains parts of reviews of all the websites.
Websites selected: Techpowerup.com and Techspot.com
These 2 websites are very reliable websites so these were chosen.
CPUs chosen:
ryzen 9 9950x3d
intel 9 285k
intel i7 14700k
ryzen 7 7700x
intel i5 13600k
ryzen 5 5600x
Why this lineup?
This lineup was chosen because it presented all the different tiers of cpus of both competitors.
Hope you like the project and definitely i would love to add more in the future.
